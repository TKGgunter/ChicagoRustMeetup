## Helpful Articles

* [Understanding rust through avl trees](https://francismurillo.github.io/2019-07-31-Understanding-Rust-Through-AVL-Trees/) - Know AVL trees? Trying to learn Rust? This might be a good resource for you! Also, if you don't know AVL trees, this will teach them to you anyway.
* [Await a minute, why bother?](https://docs.rs/dtolnay/0.0.5/dtolnay/macro._01__await_a_minute.html) - Been wondering why language-level async/await syntax is such a big deal? This article discusses how it enables comprehensible error handling, native control flow, and borrow across yield points. Also, it's written as crate documentation, which is pretty nifty.
* [Functional Programming Jargon in Rust](https://functional.works-hub.com/learn/functional-programming-jargon-in-rust-1b555) - A helpful reference explaining common functional programming terms and demonstrates how they apply to Rust.
* [Diagnostics with Tracing](https://tokio.rs/blog/2019-08-tracing/) - Writing an application with async/await? Check out the `tracing` crate for a better way to handle logging.
* [Using C Libraries in Rust](https://medium.com/dwelo-r-d/using-c-libraries-in-rust-13961948c72a) - A practical guide to using bindgen.

## Tales from Production

* [We Rewrote Our IoT Platform in Rust and Got Away With It](https://medium.com/dwelo-r-d/we-rewrote-our-iot-platform-in-rust-and-got-away-with-it-2c8867c61b67) - The first in a five part series from the folks at Dwelo talking about how (and why) they rewrote their IoT platform in Rust from Python.

## Tools and Toys

* [broot](https://github.com/Canop/broot) - An interactive directory overview and navigation tool for the terminal. Automatically uses gitignore settings to make navigating even large directorys easy.
* [topgrade](https://crates.io/crates/topgrade) - A command line utility to upgrade ALL THE THINGS at once!
* [std-async](https://async.rs/blog/announcing-async-std/) - A library designed to look and feel like the standard library, but designed around async/await from the start. Not an "official" project, but already in beta and aiming for a 1.0 release in September!
* [`<_>::v::<_>`](https://chrismorgan.info/blog/rust-artwork-owl/) - A fun little piece of Rust artwork.

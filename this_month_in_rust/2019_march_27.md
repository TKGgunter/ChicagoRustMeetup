# This March in Rust

## Helpful Articles

Articles that present useful information about how Rust (or software development in
general) works.

* [Rust: The Hard Parts - Part One](https://naftuli.wtf/2019/03/20/rust-the-hard-parts/) - A series of tips for new Rust developers to help get you over the initial learning curve and help you be productive sooner.

## Tales From Production

Stories about people using Rust to build cool things, commercially or otherwise.

* [Rust NPM Whitepaper](https://www.rust-lang.org/static/pdfs/Rust-npm-Whitepaper.pdf) - A formal case study by the Rust project developers looking at how the NPM developers used Rust to address performance issues in their authentication service. In particular, the paper highlights how Rust's community is a particular selling point.
* [From 46s to 5s - Optimizing a 350 Line Raytracer in Rust](https://medium.com/@cfsamson/from-48s-to-5s-optimizing-a-350-line-pathtracer-in-rust-191ab4a1a412)
* [Chaining Functions Without Returning Self](https://randompoison.github.io/posts/returning-self/) - A look at how method chaining is commonly implemented in Rust, and the drawbacks it can have in terms of usability.

## Toys and Things

Things built in Rust, either applications that you can run, or libraries that you can use.

* [Combine Results for Improved Rust Validation Logic](https://www.joshmcguigan.com/blog/multi-try-improved-validation-logic-rust/) - The [multi_try](https://crates.io/crates/multi_try) allows you to return multiple errors from a single function in a reasonably ergonomic way. Useful for validation logic, where there may be multiple reasons why a piece of data fails validation.
* [shellfn](https://crates.io/crates/shellfn) - A new crate that allows you to embed shell scripts (and any other interpreted scripts!) directly in your Rust code and run a subcommand to execute it.
* [Gravism Gravity Simulator](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/atdkeg/ive_been_making_a_gravity_simulator_using/) - An app that simulates gravity, allowing you to create bodies in the simulation.
* [interact 0.3.1 released](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ayga15/ann_interact_031/) - A utility that allows you to dynamically introspect the state of your program as it runs. You can connect your terminal to a running application and then use the interactive prompt to read and modify the state of your program.
* [Fast, Bump-Allocated Virtual DOMs with Rust and Wasm](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/fast-bump-allocated-virtual-doms-with-rust-and-wasm) - A detailed look at the new [dodrio](https://github.com/fitzgen/dodrio) crate, and how it uses WASM's linear memory space and Rusts's low-level control to implement a highly performant virtual DOM implementation.
* [Pedal to the metal: dynamic templates with Ramhorns](https://maciej.codes/2019-03-03-ramhorns.html) - A look at the new ramhorns dynamic templating engine and how it closes the performance gap with dynamic templating engines.

## New Toys

* **[Evcxr](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/9irjm7/evcxr_a_repl_and_jupyter_kernel_for_rust/)** - A REPL and Jupyter kernel for Rust.
* **[web-sys](https://rustwasm.github.io/2018/09/26/announcing-web-sys.html)** - Raw bindings to all web APIs! Is also future-compatible with upcoming Web Assembly changes that will "eventually unlock even-faster-than-JS DOM performance".
